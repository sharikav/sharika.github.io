            " Kanabo Research Ltd, a maker of vaporisation and inhalation technology for cannabis, is poised to become the first cannabis company to list on the London Stock Exchange when it performs an initial public offering (IPO) on Tuesday.The Israeli company is set to list on the market through a reverse takeover of Spinnaker Opportunities Plc (LON:SOP) after the transaction was approved by shareholders last week. The listing also follows a move by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) last year to allow medical, but not recreational, cannabis companies to list on the London market after medicinal use of the drug was legalised in the UK in 2018.In an IPO prospectus published on January 29, Kanabo said it has raised £6mln through the issue of around 92.3mln shares at a price of 6.5p each, while Spinnaker plans to change its name to Kanabo Group PLC once the reverse takeover is completed.The company is also expected to list on the LSE will a market value of around £23.2mln, while the £6mln raised will be used to fund its growth strategy going forward.\"I believe the UK and Europe are ready to embrace the benefits of medicinal cannabis and the overwhelming support and interest from investors has proved this. The roadshow was oversubscribed and this will help the company grow and create value faster than previously expected\", Kanabo chief executive Avihu Tamir said in the company’s prospectus on January 29.While it may be the first cannabis firm to IPO on the LSE, Kanabo will not be the only company in the space looking to draw the eye of London’s investors.Other companies, such as dual-listed phytocannabinoid derived medicines group MGC Pharmaceuticals (LON:MXC) and Aquis-listed CBD products firm Sativa Wellness Group Inc (LON:SWEL), are already looking to tap surging investor interest in the global legal cannabis market, which is expected to be worth around US$65bn by 2027 compared to around US$17.5bn at the end of 2020.\n",

            " Cybersecurity firm Darktrace is continuing to target a £4bn London initial public offer (IPO) despite broker UBS quitting the cybersecurity firm's proposed float for compliance reasons.The Swiss bank has reportedly told Darktrace that its compliance department would not allow necessary suspicious activity reports (SARs) to be signed off.It comes amidst scrutiny over the company’s ties to British tech billionaire Mike Lynch.The Swiss bank had been working on the market listing alongside Jefferies since November.Previously, according to Sky News in September, Goldman Sachs ruled itself out of a role in the IPO due to potential legal ramifications.Lynch, a founding investor in Darktrace and a former director, is presently facing possible extradition to the United States where he has been charged with 17 counts of securities and wire fraud.It follows a £3.8bn UK civil fraud case related to his former company Autonomy which was bought by Hewlett Packard for £8.4bn in 2011 (HP subsequently wrote down US$8.8bn in connection to the acquired business, alleging accounting irregularities).Lynch left the Darktrace board in 2018 and he retains an interest in the company via his investment fund Invoke Capital, one of the largest stakeholders in the pre-IPO group.According to Sky News today, a source close to Darktrace has called the Swiss bank’s resignation “a UBS issue, not a Darktrace issue” meanwhile UBS declined to comment.Insiders at Darktrace were reported to say the IPO is still “firmly on-track” and highlighted encouraging initial indications of interest from investors.Jefferies now solely leads the London float which is expected to be backed by Berenberg and private-equity group KKR (which is already a major shareholder and has previously acquired shares from Invoke).Darktrace is an artificial intelligence-led cybersecurity group, founded by University of Cambridge mathematicians.Its technology, described as ‘pioneering’, is said to be able to identify a diverse range of threats including state-sponsored espionage at their earliest stages. The company’s clients include BT Group PLC, William Hill and US insurer AIG.The company is headquartered in San Francisco and Cambridge. It has some 1,500 employees across 44 offices across the world.\n",

            " Syncona Limited (LON:SYNC) has told investors that its portfolio company Achilles Therapeutics expects to consider additional capital raise options this year, including a potential IPO in the United States.Timing and terms have yet to be determined and would be subject to market conditions, it added.This statement comes as Achilles announced that an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (IDSMC) has completed its first review of the ongoing, first-in-human Phase I/II CHIRON and THETIS trials.The committee recommendation allows both the clinical trials to continue as planned.It was a review of the first six patients dosed with the company's Clonal Neoantigen Targeting T cell therapy (cNeTs).The review observed that the overall tolerability profile was similar to that of standard tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) products that have not been enriched for cNeT reactivities, with the lymphodepletion regimen accounting for most higher-grade adverse events.Additionally, initial data from the first six patients provide encouraging evidence of cNeT engraftment. Based on these observations, the company plans to increase the administered cNeT doses in the next series of monotherapy patients.\"This independent safety review along with the initial data from our CHIRON and THETIS trials are promising and are based on patients that have been dosed with cNeTs at the lower end of our prospectively targeted therapeutic dose range,\" said Achilles chief executive Dr Iraj Ali in a statement.\"We now plan to move to higher cNeT doses and also open a combination cohort in the THETIS trial evaluating the addition of nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, following cNeT infusion, subject to further safety review.\"Achilles is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing precision T cell therapies to treat solid tumors.\n"
